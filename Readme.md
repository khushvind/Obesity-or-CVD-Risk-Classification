# Obesity Or CVD Risk Classification

The file 'Classifier.ipynb' conatains various models to classify the Obesity or CVD based on lifestyle choices and other features. To increase the efficiency I used feature engineering to generate new features, namely, BMI (Body Mass Index) and WIR (Water Intake Ratio). It was seen that adding these feature led to increase in the accuracy of the models. 

The models were trained on Random Forest Classifier, KNN, LGBM Classifier, and XGBClassifier
