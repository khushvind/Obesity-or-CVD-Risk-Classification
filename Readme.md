# Obesity Or CVD Risk Classification

The file 'Classifier.ipynb' contains various models to classify the Obesity or CVD based on lifestyle choices and other features. To increase the efficiency I used feature engineering to generate new features, namely, BMI (Body Mass Index) and WIR (Water Intake Ratio). It was observed that incorporating these feature led to increase in the accuracy of the models. 

### Models Used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- LightGBM Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

Feel free to explore the notebook to delve into the detailed implementation and results of each model.
